Perl CGI Certificate Manager
============================

My team of sysadmins was managing a few products that required us to generate CSRs with specific field values, bundle certs and keys into PKCS/12 archives, or reissue certificates with the same key but additional SANs. As the only person on my team with any familiarity with the OpenSSL command-line tools, I quickly gained a reputation as "the certificate guy". In a selfish effort to allow my co-workers to self-service some of their common tasks, I hacked together a web-based tool and ponted them at it. This is that tool.

There is no server-side persistence; keys and passphrases are stored in hidden form fields. PKCS12 bundles generated by this tool are passed through a temp file, but since we require the user to provide a passphrase this should not constitute a significant leak even if someone was to grab them off disk for the short period of time they're present. Although anyone with access to the web server's temp files could probably also figure out how to grab your passphrase out of the POST data. If you're paranoid, don't use this tool.

This tool is meant to run in Apache's mod_perl or any other common CGI environment. It requires a number of Perl OpenSSL modules, as well as the venerable `CGI.pm`. Perl module dependency installation is a mess, but you can probably get what you need installed with `cpanm --installdeps .` .
